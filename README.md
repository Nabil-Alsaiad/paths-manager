## About

<table>
<tr>
<td>

Discord bot projects usually maintain a lot of files due to every file being a separate command, event, handler or some data storing json files, so keeping the files organized in tree structure folders like "commands/moderation/admins-only/ban.js", yet keeping track of each file path in order to reference it anywhere inside your commands, for example: if you're making a test command to test the welcome event message rather than kicking and re-joining from another acount it'd be better to have a test command and be somewhere like "commands/tests/event-tests/welcome-test.js" and you want to require the event located at "events/guild/welcome.js" so you can call it from the tets command, you propably would write something like ```const welcome = require('../../../events/guild/welcome.js');``` which will work fine until you move any of the files or change the name of one of their folders and that will break everything, you can just change the path text but if you're doing the same thing for every other command and event you have?, just moving the "commands/tests" folder will require you to change all path texts in all test command files and of course you don't want that, we programmers hate doing repetitive work ourselves so much that's why we made this tool, to help automate this work.

Key features of **paths-manager**:

- Save all file paths inside a main folder or it's subfolder
- Get the full path of any stored file from anywhere in your project
- Get full paths of all stored files within a main folder or it's subfolder

<details open>
<summary>Additional important info</summary>
<br>

paths-manager keeps the stored paths in variables, meaning they'll be lost once the project is stopped and you'll need to save the files every time you run it

paths-manager will auto detect all main folders if non were specified in the save files function.

paths-manager finding functions will require the extension of the file name.

when having a file with the same name as an other file, paths-manager will return the first one it finds.
